I am a PhD Candidate in the Machine Learning Group at the Chair of Scientific Computing at Technical University Munich.
My interests are mainly in scientific machine learning methodology and robustness. I enjoy a healthy
amount of theoretical work as well as the necessary amount of software development.

## Currently working on

- [FORWARD Project](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/en/gni/gni-funded-projects/forward/)

## Past Experience

### Self-study 2023

- Went thgough a course on discrete mathematics
- Learned some basic statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations
- Learned some basic web-development

### Master's in Computational Science and Engineering (2021-2023)

- Learned some programming languages / tools: C++, OpenMP, OpenMPI, Git, Docker
- Deepened my theoretical understanding of numerical analysis and linear algebra
- Learned more statistics / probability theory
- Learned about algorithms and datastructures
- Got exposed to high performance computing (HPC)
- Got some experience with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
- Thesis: Deep coarse-grained potentials with thermodynamic-state dependency (Chair of Multiscale Modeling of Fluid Materials)

### Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (2017-2020)

- Went though a standard engineering education
- Learned some programming languages / tools: C, Python, Java, LaTeX, GitLab
- Developed an interest in scientific machine learning from a seminar on "Deep Learning in Fluid Mechanics"
- Learned about numerical algorithms through electives
- Learned about machine learning / deep learning through electives
